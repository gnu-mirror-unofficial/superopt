This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.

* copyright policy
*** update every year, unconditionally
*** (if (< 2 (- END BEGIN)) RANGE INDIVIDUAL)
* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** next -- stuff for the next release
    This branch is work for the next release.  It will never be rebased.
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    A rebase MUST be announced to the bug-report address.
    Hackers probably want to start here.
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
